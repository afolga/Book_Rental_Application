# Book_Rental_Application
Hi! My name is Agnes Folga. I am a current Masters in Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago (graduating May 2023). 
Besides programming and learning about all things CS, one of my favorite hobbies is to read - which inspired this project. 
In this project, I try to create a mock book rental application. 
Here, users can 
 - create a user account
 - perform CRUD operations:  create a new book listing, edit a book listing, book ISBN number , delete book listing
 - see if a book is available to rent or not 
 - allow book renters to create a "renters account"
